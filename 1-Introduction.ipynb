    "Nanosatellites are increasingly used as low-cost dedicated sensing systems for astronomical data. Kyushu Institute of Technology (Kyutech) and collaborators have launched a joint venture for a nanosatellite mission, Visible Extragalactic background RadiaTion Exploration by CubeSat [(**VERTECS**)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/13092/130920W/Astronomical-6U-CubeSat-mission-VERTECS--scientific-objective-and-project/10.1117/12.3014708.short). The primary purpose is to gain information about the formation history of stars by observing the optical-wavelength extragalactic background light (EBL). The **VERTECS** satellite will be equipped with a small-aperture telescope and a high-precision attitude control system to capture the astronomical data for analysis on the ground."

These limitations affect computational power, onboard storage, and communication capabilities, leading to slower data transmission. As a result, they struggle to send large volumes of data quickly, which can impact the efficiency of missions that rely on fast or continuous data updates."
