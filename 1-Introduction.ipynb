    "Nanosatellites are increasingly used as low-cost dedicated sensing systems with lean development cycles. Kyushu Institute of Technology (Kyutech) and collaborators have launched a joint venture for a nanosatellite mission, Visible Extragalactic background RadiaTion Exploration by CubeSat (**VERTECS**). The primary mission is to clarify the formation history of stars by observing the optical-wavelength cosmic background radiation. The **VERTECS** satellite will be equipped with a small-aperture telescope and a high-precision attitude control system to capture the astronomical data for analysis on the ground."

    " However, nanosatellites/CubeSats have one prominent disadvantage lies in their size and weight constraints. Being small and compact significantly affects the computational power and onboard storage capacity available for data processing and analysis during missions. Moreover, the small surface area leaves limited space for communication equipment. This can make it hard for them to maintain strong connections with ground stations, leading to slower data transmission. As a result, they may not be able to send large amounts of data quickly, which can be a problem for missions needing fast or continuous data updates. "

The goal is to prioritize which images are most valuable for transmission back to Earth, given the limited onboard resources and slow data downlink speeds.
